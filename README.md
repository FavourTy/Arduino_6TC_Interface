# Arduino_6TC_Interface
This Arduino project interfaces an Arduino Nano with six thermocouples using MAX6675 modules to measure temperatures. The project reads temperature values from the thermocouples and displays them via serial communication.

# Prerequisites
Before you begin, make sure you have the following:
* Arduino IDE installed on your computer.
* An Arduino Nano board.
* Six MAX6675 modules.
* Thermocouples for temperature sensing.
* Copper wires or Jumperwires
* Veroboard or breadboard

# Hardware Setup
Connect the components as follows:

Arduino Nano:

* Connect pin 2 to the SCK pin of all MAX6675 modules.
* Connect pin 3 to the SO pin of all MAX6675 modules.
* Connect pins 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, and 12 to the CS pins of the respective MAX6675 modules for thermocouples 1 to 6.

MAX6675 Modules:

* Connect VCC to 5V power source.
* Connect GND to ground.
* Connect VCC and GND to the respective pins on the thermocouples.

# Usage
* Open the Arduino IDE and upload the provided code in this reposistory to your Arduino Nano board.
* Open the Serial Monitor (baud rate: 9600) to view the temperature readings from the thermocouples.
* The serial monitor will display temperature readings for each thermocouple (T1 to T6) in Celsius.
